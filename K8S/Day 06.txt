Project: App + DB

Stateful Containers & Stateless Containers
--------------------------------------------------------
stateful container maintains the data permanently
stateless container wont maintains the data permanently

In stateless containers based apps for every request they will get new data and it will process that data
	Ex: nodeJS, Nignx, SpringBoot...
	Every request that is coming to the app will be treated as a new request
In stateful containers based apps they will keep track of data
	Ex:MySQL, Oracle, Postgress

In K8S we have 2 important concepts;
	1. deployment - used for stateless apps
	2. statefulset - used for stateful apps
If you want to deploy the DB in the EKS cluster, 'statefulset' is recommended
If you are deploying the frontend of app, we will use stateless app i.e 'deployment'

Deployment Vs StatefulSet
--------------------------------------
Deployment will create the pods with Random IDs/Names
Deployment will scale down the pods in random order
Deployment pods are stateless pods

StatefulSet will create the pods with sticky identity
StatefulSet will scale down the pods in reverse order
StatefulSet pods are stateful pods

2 Pods DB - Total 5 pods for DB --- replica = 7

A statefulset is the K8S controller that is used to run the stateful app as containers (pods) in the cluster

Deployment - Stateless app weshopify-app-db-deployment-84cd8bbd9-hzxmd
Staefulset - Statefull App mysql-db-0
					mysql-db-1
					mysql-db-2

here 0,1,2,3,4.. are called as pod ids
0 - primary pod/replica
1,2,3,4.. - secondary pods/replicas
0,1,2,3,4... - stickey identities

In statefulset a new pod is created by cloning the previous pod data
if the previous pods is in pending state, then new pods will not get created
the pod id will always start from "ZERO"
when using deployment when we scale down to 2 pods, the data in 1 pod will be lost. hence 'deployment' is not recommended
For every pod PV & PVC will be available . here pod 0 pod 1 are called as stateful pods




Service type if given as None then that service is called as "Headless" service
