Operating System
--------------------------
OS is a software which is used to interact with the machine.
Acts as a mediator between a user and machine.
OS is mandatory to use any device.
It provides an environment to run an app.

Types of OS;
Windows, Linux, Mac

Linux Distributions;
RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, 

Linux Vs Windows
----------------------------
Linux: Open-source, community-driven, free (most distributions).
Windows: Closed-source, proprietary, requires a paid license.

Source Code and Customization
Linux: Open-source, highly customizable (kernels, UI).
Windows: Closed-source, limited customization without third-party tools.

User Interface
Linux: Multiple desktop environments (GNOME, KDE). Powerful shells (Bash, Zsh).
Windows: Standardized graphical UI, Command Prompt and PowerShell available.

Software and Compatibility
Linux: Extensive open-source applications, limited gaming support (improving via Steam/Proton).
Windows: Wide range of commercial software, excellent gaming support.

Performance and Resource Usage
Linux: Efficient on older hardware, faster boot times with lightweight distros.
Windows: Resource-intensive, moderate to slow boot times.

Security
Linux: Fewer vulnerabilities, strict user permissions, generally no antivirus needed.
Windows: Frequent malware target, more lenient permissions, antivirus is essential.

Updates
Linux: Frequent, user-controlled updates; rarely requires a reboot.
Windows: Scheduled, sometimes forced updates; often requires a reboot.

Use Cases
Linux: Servers, programming, DevOps, IoT devices.
Windows: Personal computing, gaming, business environments.

Linux Commands
--------------------------
1. To clear the screen
clear (or) control + l

2. To know the date and time
date

3. To see the calendar

6. To see the disc utilization

7. To come out/exit of the previous command screen
control + c

8. Types of users available in Linux OS
We have 2 types of users by default;
1. ec2-user (default user)
2. root

Difference b/w ec2-user and root user;
If you are the ec2-user, you will not be allowed to install the softwares/packages/tools. Permissions are limited
If you are the root user, you will have all kinds of privileges/permissions

9. To know the current type of user
whoami

10. To switch to root user
sudo su

11. To switch to the ec2-user
exit (or) control+d

In Linux OS we have two important things;
1. Directories (Folders)
2. Files - .txt, .py, .java, .php, .net.....

12. How to create a directory?
mkdir <DirectoryName>

13. To see/verify the list of directories/files available
ls (or) ls -l (or) ll

14. To see the current working path/directory
pwd (Present Working Directory)

15. To go inside a specific directory
cd <DirectoryName>

16. To go to the previous path
cd .. (to go one step backward)
cd ../.. (to go two steps backward)
cd ../../.. (to go three steps backward)

17. To delete an empty directory
rmdir <DirectoryName>

18. To delete a directory which contains sub-directories/files
rm -rf <DirectoryName>
Recursive
Force

19. To see the list of default directories
cd /
ls (or) ls -l (or) ll

20. To go inside a default directory
cd <DirectoryName>

21. To create files in Linux OS we have 3 ways/methods;
1. touch
2. cat
3. vi (or) vim

22. Create a file using 'touch'
touch <FileName>

23. To create multiple files at the same time
touch <File1Name> <File2Name> <File3Name> <File4Name>

24. To create multiples files with same name but with little change
linux1.txt
linux2.txt
linux3.txt
....
linux10.txt

touch <FileFirstName>{1..10}.java
touch <FileFirstName>{11..15}.py
touch <FileFirstName>{8..10}.txt

25. To delete a single file
rm <FileName>

26. To delete multiple files
