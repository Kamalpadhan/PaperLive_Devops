Why Python for DevOps Engineers?

Shell Scripting is mostly suitable for Linux OS only
Python will work both for Linux OS and Windows OS

When you want to write complex scripting, interact with APIs, perform data manipulations then we will use Python

Python is a high-level programming language
Python is versatile and dynamically typed
Python is a general purpose language
Introduced in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum

Features of Python;
Platform Independent
Most widely used programming language
It has large community
It has rich libraries - pandas, numpy, etc...
Easy to learn and read
It is a multi-purpose language
Python code doesn't require compilation

JAVA Code - Web App
JVM - Compile (.java ---> .class) - Build the artifact (.jar or .war)

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


PYTHON Code
print("Hello, World!")

-----------------------------
Installation of Python
-----------------------------
1. Create a server and install python - work with python
2. Install Python locally - Install IDE
3. GitHub - 60 hrs/month
4. Google Colab

All the python files will have an extension as .py
---------------------
Python Datatypes
---------------------
Python File (Kastro.py) --- Text, Numbers, Special Characters...
Everything that is available in a python file is considered as "DATA" by interpreters

Datatypes in Python;
String/List of Characters
Numeric (Int, Float, Complex)
Sequence (String, List, Tuple)
Mapping (Dict)
Boolean (True/False)
Binary types
None type
Custom Data Type

How does a compiler understand what datatype is there in the Python file?
	- The only way how Compiler understand the datatype is by using SYNTAX

In Python 'indentations' or 'whitespaces' are very important


Single line comment and multi line comment

Single line comment - put # at the beginning of a line

Multi line comment - put """ at the beginning and ending

Variables

Numeric
	1. INT		- Ex: 1,2,3,4,5,6,100,0
	2. Float		- Ex: 1.1, 2.99, 3.1998877

String
name="Kastro"
name='Kiran'

xyz = 'This is Kastro - DevOps Trainer' OR "This is Kastro - DevOps Trainer"
xyz = "You are all Kastro's DevOps Student's"


Lets say i have 3 lines of string;
'''
This is Kastro
Im DevOps Trainer
I'm a PhD Scholar
'''

"""
This is Kastro
Im DevOps Trainer
I'm a PhD Scholar
"""

Boolean - True or False
