Service 11: VPC
----------------------------
1. VPC Flow logs
-----------------------------
Additional charges
To know who is accessing the VPC Network
Flowlogs can be enabled in 3 levels;
	1. VPC Level
	2. Subnet Level
	3. ENIs (Elastic Network Interface)

All the logs will be analyzed using Guard Duty. If we just enable Guard Duty and send the VPC flowlogs to it, it will do the analysis and thus it helps us to take necessary action.
Flowlogs can capture ACCEPTED, REJECTED, ALL
All the logs can be published to S3 Bucket or CloudWatch Logs
To share the logs to 3rd party services (Splunk, Sumologic) we will use Kinesis Firehouse
What kind of info we will be getting in flowlogs?
	Source IP, Destination IP, Packet Size, Source Port, Destination Port, Call is accepted/rejected
Flowlogs will come every 1 min or every 10 minutes
	- every 10 minutes (default)

Service 12: RDS
--------------------------
Relational Database Service
Region specific
RDS Instances
Highly cost

App -----> Database (RDS)

Data is a collection of values or information
Database is an organized collection of data
3 types of data;
	1 Structured
	2 Unstructured
	3 Semi structured

Structured data; typically stores the data in table format with pre-defined structures/schema
commonly used in relational databases
suitable for complex queries and analytics

Unstructured data; it has unorganized. No defined schema

Semi structured data; it has unorganized  data but not constrained by a fixed schema
mostly the data is available in JSON or XML format

As a cloud engineer, we just have to create the RDS instance with required configurations and give the database instance to the database engineers

NoSQL, SQL, Oracle, Aurora...
