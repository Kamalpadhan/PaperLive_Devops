													Day 11_AWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Service 7: Cloud Watch 
Service 8: AWS Event Bridge
Service 9: Cloud Trial
Service 10: Route 53

CPU < 15% -----> STOP

Service 9: Cloud Trial
-------------------------------------
AWS Services ---- Console, CLI, SDK, Programmatic API ---- Cloud Trial Logs
CT is a activity monitoring tool
By default, CT will be enabled for our account ---- No Additional Charges
by default, only last 90 days logs will be stored in Event History of CT
To store more than 90 days logs, we need to create 'Custom Trial' --- Additional Charges
Default created logs are known as 'Event History'

Types of events in CT;
1. Management Event	- Launch VM, Create Bucket, Create IAM User, Create IAM Role
2. Data Event			- uploaded an object, enabled versioning, deleted an object

Currently 'data event' type is supported to S3, Lambda, Dynamo DB
Management event is available for all AWS Services

Custom Trials can be create in one region or also in multiple regions
CT is a region specific service
EC2 - Region Specific - Mumbai - CT logs will be available only in Mumbai region
But if you are working with Global services, in such case CT logs will be available only in N.Virginia

To store the logs of CT, we can integrate CT with S3 or CW Logs
Atleast 5-10 minutes delay will be there in publishing logs

Service 10: Route 53
----------------------------------
Route 53 is a DNS service available in AWS
53 is the DNS port number
In Route 53, we will create records (tasks)
	- 2 EC2 VMs -----> Zomato App -----> Public IP 1, Public IP 2 -----> It is not recommended to provide the IPs to end users in order to access 	  the app -----> Attach these 2 VMs to ELB -----> LB URL (lengthy url)  -----> It is not recommended to ask users to access the app using LB 	  URL -----> LB URL will be mapped to a domain -----> Domain is available in Route 53
	- Record will convert the lengthy url of LB into the shortest domain url (www.zomato.com)

Browser -----> Any browser requires 2 things; 1. Hostname, 2. IP Address -----> From the browser, the request will got to Local DNS -----> From Local DNS, the request will go to RNS (Root Name Server) -----> From RNS, the request goes to TLD (Top Level Domain) -----> From TLD, the request goes to Name Server (NS) -----> From NS, the request goes to SOA

DNS keeps all the host names and IP addresses. It will track all the hostnames and IPs.
	- DNS can convert the hostname to IP and IP to hostname
	- Ex: Zomato.com -----> 123.132.143.134
To know the IP address of any website, we will use 'ns loopkup'

In Route 53, we need to configure Nameserver and SOA

Route 53 is a global service

Route 53 features;
1. Domain registration
2. DNS routing
3. Health checks
4. Routing policies

DNS is all about records
In Route 53, the first we will create is Hosted Zone
This hosted zone contains records

The name of the hosted zone that we should create is the Domain Name (.com, .in., .gov, .edu...)
Hosted zone and domain name are same

Types of hosted zones;
1. Public HZ		- websites will be available on internet - generally preferred
2. Private HZ		- if you want to access a website within a specific network, we will use Private HZ

HZ ----> Records ----> www.kastro.com ----> This Kastro.com will be routed to LB URL ----> LB URL will route the traffic EC2 Instances ----> Inside the EC2 Instances, our app is hosted

Whenever we create a public hosted zone, 2 records will be created automatically
	1. NS Record		- It is a pool of 4 servers
	2. SOA Record	- Admin for hosted zone. It has IP address

NS and SOA records are automatically created and managed/handled by AWS ---- only when the domain is purchased using Route 53

Suppose if the domain is purchased through 3rd party websites, how Route 53 works?
	- In this case, we need to manually create a hosted zone in Route 53 and then automatically NS and SOA records will be created
	- Kastro.com ---> Godaddy ----> When users access Kastro.com, the request will go to godaddy website. But in godaddy website nothing is 	there related to our app. All app infra available in AWS. Here, we need to establish connection from godaddy to route 53. For this purpose, 	what we need to do is, we know that whenever we create a hosted zone, these 4 servers we will  update in godaddy.
	- Whenever we purchase a domain using 3rd party site, latency issues will be there

Note: NS and SOA records shouldn't be deleted. If deleted, app will not work
