Service 2: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Topics:
Day 07 Task: Monitoring EC2 Instance using CloudWatch (CPU Utilization) 

1. EBS - Concept
2. EBS - Creation of EBS and attach to running VM
3. EBS - Resizing and Changing the EBS type
4. EBS - Multiattach
5. EBS - Snapshot
6. ASG & LB - Concept

1. EBS - Concept
-------------------------------
Types of EBS volumes;
1. SSD Type - better performance
2. HDD Type - slow performance
3. Previous generation

SSD - 
The data which is accessed frequently 
SSD is majorly used when we have less data but which is accessed frequently 
The advantage of using SSD is, it works on IOPS (Input Output Per Second)

HDD -
It is used when we have large data but it is accessed less frequently
HDD functions based on "throughput" method (MBPS/GBPS)
Ex: In Big Data Analytics, HDD is used

Previous generation -
It is an outdated EBS volume

Types of SSD;
1. General purpose
	- When there is a normal usage of data, then we select GP instance type
	- By default, all the EC2 instances will be launched using GP
	- GP is of 2 types;
		a) gp2
		b) gp3
2. Provisioned IOPS
	- When there is a rapid access of data, then we select Provisioned IOPS
	- IOPS is of 3 types;
		a) io1
		b) io2
		c) io2 Block Express (Supported by R5B instance type)


Note: EBS Multiattach is supported only in SSD type and in particularly it is supported in Provisioned IOPS, only for NITRO based instances

Snapshot - backup of EBS volume
AMI		- backup of instance

10.00 EBS (10 GB) - Snapshot 1 (Complete backup)
05.00 EBS (10 + 8 GB) - Snapshot 2 (Only the additional storage/data will be taken as backup)

Incremental backups - additional storage will be taken as a backup in new snapshots

EBS Multiattach

Autoscaling & Load Balancer
----------------------------------

EC2 - Max of 100 requests per second - 

What is Autoscaling? 
It is the concept of automatically increasing or decreasing the number of instances based on the traffic coming to the application.
Scale in (decreasing) and Scale out (increasing)

To scale in or scale out the instances using autoscaling, we will use server metrics. 
These metrics are provided by Cloud Watch service
CPU Utilization 
	CPU Utilization > 85% - increase
	CPU Utilization < 20% - decrease

Note: 24x7 one server should be available for the application to run

Types of autoscaling;
1. Horizontal autoscaling - is the addition of same configured servers. HAS doesn't have downtime. By default, AWS provides only HAS
2. Vertical autoscaling - is the addition of differently configured servers based on load, by delete the existing server and will create a new server. VAS will have downtime. It is manual work

AS supports EC2, RDS, ECS, Dynamo DB

Load Balancer;
LB will distribute the traffic equally to all the instances
LB has Target Groups
1 LB will have a minimum capacity of 10 Billion requests/seconds (1 Million requests/second)
LB can also perform the health checks for the instances. If the health of any instance is found bad, LB will terminate that instance and will create a new instance 

LB ---> Autoscaling Group

Whenever we are working with autoscaling concept; we have 2 steps;
	1. Creating the launch template (Previously we used to have Launch Configuration)
	2. Creating the autoscaling group
			2.1. Desired capacity - at the time of launching an app how many servers i need on immediate basis 
			2.2. Minimum capacity - at any given point of time, irrespective of the traffic coming to the app, how many servers i need to have
			2.3. Maximum capacity - at a maximum for my app, how many servers should be available 

HAS has 3 types of AS;
1. Dynamic scaling - is based on CPU threshold value
2. Scheduled scaling - is based on business hours (11.00-1.00 PM) 
3. Predictive scaling - AWS itself decides when to create and when delete the servers. it is based on ML algorithm

Load Balancer types;
1. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 
2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
3. Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) - AWS will not recommend this. It is an old version of LB
