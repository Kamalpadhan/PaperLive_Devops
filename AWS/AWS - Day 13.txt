Service 11: VPC
----------------------------
VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
VPC is a region specific service
Once we create an AWS Account, in every region we will get one default VPC attached with Subnets, Route Tables, and IGW

To create a VPC, we have to create a Network

CIDR 
Classless Inter Domain Routing - a method for allocating IP addresses
CIDR consists of two components;
1. Base IP		- represents an IP which contains with in the specified range
2. Subnet mask	- defines how many bits can change in the IP
Subnet mask allows part of the underlying IP address to get from the base IP

132.198.168.0/32

Types of IP
1. IPv4 - contains 4 octects (Ex: 100.111.222.333). Each octect will have 8 bits. The total size is 32 bits
2. IPv6 - contains 8 octects. Each octect is separated by : IPv6 is an alphanumeric IP address. Each octect will have 16 bits
IPv6 is introduced to overcome the IPv4 address exhaustion

132.142.155.166/32 ----- 2^0 = 1
/31 ---- 2^1 = 2
/30 ---- 2^2 = 4
/29 ---- 2^3 = 8


132.142.0.0/32 ----- 132.142.0.0
132.142.0.0/31 ----- 132.142.0.0, 132.142.0.1
132.142.0.0/30 ----- 132.142.0.0, 132.142.0.1, 132.142.0.2




132.142.0.0./0 ---- 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 ----> Allows all IPs

Types of IPs;
1. Public IP --- is used to connect to the server outside of the network
2. Private IP --- is used to connect to the server within the network (VPC Peering)

The components in VPC
----------------------------------
1. VPC - its a custom network

2. Subnets - is a logical partitioning of a network into smaller IP ranges
A subnet is a range of IPv4 addresses in VPC
AWS will reserve 5 IPs (first 4 and last) in each subnet
These 5 IPs are not available for use and cannot be assigned to an EC2 instance
Ex: 10.0.0.0/24 --- 256 IPs (256-5 = 251 IPs)
10.0.0.0 - Network address
10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for VPC router
10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS for mapping to amazon provided DNS
10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use
10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address

2^32-n

Ex: If you need 29 IPs
	-- You cannot chose a subnet of size /27 (32 IPs ====> 32 - 5 = 27 < 29)
	-- You need to chose a subnet of size /26 (64 IPs =====> 64 - 5 = 59 > 29)

Types of subnets;
1. Public subnet - allows all type traffic
2. Private subnet - allows limited traffic

The number of default subnets in a region depends on AZs

3. Route Tables
RT will help us to divert/route the traffic
Public RT
Private RT
Each subnet is associated with a RT

4. Internet Gateway
Allows resources in a VPC to connect to the internet
Must be created separately from a VPC
Attach IGW to VPC
RT must also be created to make IGW work
Note: If we attach IGW to a subnet then that subnet is called as Public Subnet

5. NAT Gateway
NAT - Network Address Translator
NATGW is created only in Public Subnet
NATGW will only have outgoing traffic
The RT are connected to NATGW
NATGW enables outbound internet access for private subnets
VPC Sizing
------------------
The process of deciding no. of IPs required for VPC and no. of IPs required for subnets is called as VPC Sizes
VPC sizing will be calculated in 2^

-----------------------
NACL vs SG
-----------------------
SG
1. SG acts as a firewall to secure our resources
2. SG contains inbound rules and outbound rules
	inbound rule ---- controls incoming traffic
	outbound rule ---- controls outgoing traffic
3. In one SG we can add a maximum of 50 rules
4. SG supports only Allow rules
5. Multiple SGs can be attached to single instance and one instance can have a maximum of 5 SGs
6. SGs are stateful (any changes applied to incoming rules will be applicable for outgoing rules also)

NACL
Network Access Control List
NACL acts as a firewall for the subnets in VPC
NACL is applicable at the subnet level
NACL rules are applicable for all the resources  which are part of that subnet
NACL rules are stateless (Any changes applied to incoming rules will not be applicable for outgoing rues. We need to explicitly allow the rules)
NACL we can configure both Allow and Deny rules
One subnet can have only one NACL
One NACL can be added to multiple subnets


AWS VPC Endpoints
----------------------------------
To connect from a VPC to any AWS service privately, we will use VPC endpoint
Types of VPC endpoints
1. Interface endpoints
2. Gateway endpoints
3. Gateway loadbalancer endpoints
