Before enabling versioning
1st time ----> Kastro.txt ----> Amazon Web Services (20:17:49)
2nd time  ----> Kastro.txt ----> AWS (20:19:37)
3rd time  ----> Kastro.txt ----> Amazon Web Services (20:22:28) - NULL

After enabling versioning
4th time  ----> Kastro.txt ----> Microsoft Azure (20:27:33)
5th time  ----> Kastro.txt ----> GCP (20:31:53)

3. S3 Replication Setup
If you want to copy the files from one bucket to another bucket then we will use REPLICATION concept

Ways of replications;
1. 2 buckets in same region and same account
2. 1 bucket is in one region and another bucket is in another region, but both buckets are in same account
3. Both buckets are in different account

1. Bucket1 --- 1 file -- STANDARD
2. Bucket2 --- GLACIER


Note: When we want to replicate the objects from one bucket to another bucket, then it is mandatory to enable versioning for both buckets

4. Data Sync
When we have large size of files (GB/PB...), and when you want to replicate those large files into another bucket, we need to use DATA SYNC service

7. Working with AWS CLI
CLI - Command Line Interface
1. Install CLI in local system
2. Create IAM User - Generate Access and Secret Access Keys
3. Configure AWS
4. Work with commands


To configure AWS ----> aws configure
To see the list of buckets --- aws s3 ls
To create a bucket ---- aws s3 mb s3://<BucketName>
To upload an object into the bucket ---- aws s3 cp <LocalFilePath> s3://<BucketName>/<ObjectName>
To delete an object inside a bucket --- aws s3 rm s3://<BucketName>/<ObjectName>
To delete the bucket which contains objects --- aws s3 rb s3://<BucketName> --force
