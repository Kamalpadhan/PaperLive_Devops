Why the organizations has switched to the Cloud?


What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing data over the internet (The Cloud). 

On Premises Vs Virtual Servers
The servers which are available a physical location is known as "ON-PREMISES"
The servers which are launched using cloud service provider AWS,GCP, Azure) is known as "VIRTUAL SERVERS"

Cloud Service Providers;
AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM, VM Ware, Sales force, Alibaba Cloud...
To work with any cloud service, we need to have an account

Account creation - credit/debit, valid email id, password

Why companies are using the Cloud?
XYZ ----> Netflix ----> Regular days: 1L requests/second ---> On offer days: The traffic will get increased and you may need servers to handle the additional traffic ---> Purchase them and then you have to use. Since they are all physical servers, you cannot resale them and you cannot keep them idle. Here the major problem with Physical Servers is its maintenance and autoscaling
Cloud will take care of every  you neeed to pay for what you have used

Cloud Models;
1. Service based models - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service)
2. Deployment based models - Public, Private, Hybrid, Community Cloud

IaaS - All the underlying infrastructure will be provided by the cloud service provider. 
		Customer - The OS, Runtime, App, Data
			Ex: The builder will provider only the flat not the infrastructure 
					Ex: EC2


PaaS - Along with infrastructure, facilities will also be provided
		Ex: Studio Apartment (House + Furniture - TV - Samsung)
			Ex: RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB


SaaS - Hotel Suite Room

AWS is a combination of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

Public Cloud - anybody can access
Private Cloud - only few people can access
Hybrid Cloud - partly public and partly private
Community Cloud - IBM Cloud
