Service 6: IAM - Identity and Access Management

IAM Role;
	- Service based roles
	- Account based roles

Service 7: Cloud Watch 
Service 8: Cloud Trial
 
CW is a resource monitoring tool
CT is activity monitoring tool
CW can monitor all AWS services
CW is having 3 important features;
	- Alarms
	- Events
	- Logs

EC2 instance --- Launched an app ---- To monitor the VM, we have something known as "Host Level Metrics"
	- Metrics are nothing but CPU, Network, Status Check, Disk.
		- CW can only monitor the above 4 host level metrics. These are default metrics

Two types of monitorings;
	1. Basic monitoring		- every 5 minutes we will get data points - FREE
	2. Detailed monitoring	- every minute we will get data points	- BILLABLE


ALARMS
---------------------
In CW, we will create Alarms
Alarms can send notifications and they can also perform some actions such as stop, terminate, reboot, recover
CW alarms cannot START ec2 instances
CW alarm has 3 states - 1) In Alarm	2) OK	3) Insufficient

EC2 Instance - CPU Utilization - >80% - Notification should come
	- If it is going >80%, the alarm state will be IN ALARM
	- If it is <80%, the alarm state will be OK
	- If an EC2 instance is stopped, the alarm state will be INSUFFICIENT
There is another concept in CW known as Composite Alarms
Generally, CW alarms are single metric
Composite alarms can monitor the different states of multiple alarms
	Conditions: AND condition, OR condition

EVENTS
--------------------
All CW events are stored in Event Bridge
EC2 instance - 6 states

LOGS
-------------------
Two types;
1. System logs
2. App logs

I will launch an EC2 instance in which i have to install "CW Agent". Once the CW Agent is installed, it will give the logs in /etc/awslogs path
Inside the path (/etc/awslogs) we will have 2 files. We need to modify these files and tell that where is our log directory. Only after doing this, all the logs will be pushed to "CW Logs"

CW Agent doesn't have any access to push the logs to CW Logs. To do this we need to create IAM Role. For this role, we will give CWFullAccess permission. This role will be attached to EC2 instance


CW Demo 3
EC2 Instance - CPU < 20%, i need to stop the instance, CPU > 80%, i need to create additional instance
