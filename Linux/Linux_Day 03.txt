65. File Permissions
Whenever we execute ls -l or ll command we will see the meta data of a file or a directory. As a part of metadata, we will see something like below;
rw-r--r--
In general, a file permission in Linux is divided into 3 categories;
1. User permissions (u)
2. Group permissions (g)
3. Others permissions (o)

WhatsApp Group ----> Admin
10 persons added ----> Group Settings (Messages, Group Profile Pic, Group Description)

File ----> Decide the permissions
In Linux, we have 3 types of permissions;
1. read permission (r)
2. write permission (w)
3. execute permission (x)

Ex: -rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  66 Dec 26 15:05 dipesh.java

dipesh.java ----> rw-r--r--

First 3 characters represent the "User permissions"
Second 3 characters represent the "Group permissions"
Third 3 characters represent the "Others permissions"

dipesh.java ----> Users (r w -)
dipesh.java ----> Group (r - -)
dipesh.java ----> Others (r - -)

66. Customizing the file permissions
chmod

67. How to add a read permission for user
kastro.txt ----> rw-r--r--
chmod u+r <FileName>

68. How to add write permission for user
chmod u+w <FileName>

69. How to add execute permission for user
chmod u+x <FileName>

70. How to add a read permission for group
kastro.txt ----> rw-r--r--
chmod g+r <FileName>

71. How to add write permission for group
chmod g+w <FileName>

72. How to add execute permission for 
chmod g+x <FileName>

<OTHERS PERMISSIONS IS A TASK>

73. To remove the file permissions use - symbol
Ex: chmod g-r <FileName>  ----> In this command for the file, for group category read permission will be removed

74. Using Numbers we can change the file permissions
0 - No permissions
1 - only execute permission
2 - only write permission
3 - write and execute permission
4 - only read permission
5 - read and execute permission
6 - read and write permission
7 - read, write, execute permission

chmod 12 <FileName>

Note: When you give 1 or 2 numbers, the permissions will be changed from RIGHT side to LEFT side
Note: When you give 3 numbers, the permissions will be changed from LEFT side to RIGHT side

75. Users in Linux
Default users in Linux;
1. ec2-user
2. root

76. How to create the custom users?
Note: You must be a root user to create the users ----> sudo su (or) sudo -i
Note: Without switching to the root user, we can sudo at the beginning of command to become a root user temporarily

sudo useradd <UserName>

77. To verify the user creation
id <UserName>

Ex: uid=1001(kastro) gid=1001(kastro) groups=1001(kastro)

78. Switching to the custom user
sudo su <UserName>

79. To remove a custom user
sudo userdel <UserName>

80. To see the list of users created
First go inside /home path and then execute the ls -l or ll command





sudo passwd <UserName>


90. chown ---> Change ownership
When we create a file or directory and execute ll or ls -l command we will see ec2-user ec2-user
The first ec2-user represent the owner of a file
The second ec2-user represent the file belongs to which group

91. How to change the ownership of file
sudo chown <UserName> <FileName>

92. How to change the group permission of a file
sudo chown <UserName>:<GroupName> <FileName>

93. To search for the files which are empty
sudo find /home -type f -empty

94. To search for the directories which are empty
sudo find /home -type d -empty

95. 
wget ----> used to download files/softwares based on url
curl ----> used to send a request to an url
ping ----> user to check the network connectivity

96. Package managers
yum - Yellowdog Updater, Modifier - Linux OS
apt - Advanced Packaging Tool - Ubuntu OS
dnf - Dandified yum
dpkg - Debian Package Management System
rpm - Redhad Package Manager - RedHat

SHELL SCRIPTING
--------------------------------

How to check the shell type?
echo $0

To know the default shells available in linu
cat /etc/shells

All shell files should have an extension called .sh

To execute a shell file
./<FileName>

.yaml (or) .yml files
YAML - Yet Another Markup Language

Variables
------------------
Variables are the places where we store the information
bank = money
a=10

Syntax: VAR_NAME=VALUE
